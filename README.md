In 2016, after a long hiatus, I returned to Linux and Arch was a nice discovery for me (knew about it before, of course, but, never used it for real). I ditched the desktop enviroments and went the minimalist/terminal/VM way (started with i3, tried many VMs, settled with dwm and also switched from Arch to Artix).

So far so good! :)

## dwm (6.4)

(+ some small custom tweaks)

## st (0.9)

My build of the Suckless Simple Terminal. Also simple and effective with not too many patches:

- del key (del key is not functional by default)
- focus (separate alpha for the main/aux windows)
- font 2 (so you can use backup fonts)
- scrollback & scrollback mouse (scrolling is not a default option in ST)

## i3 (legacy)
Nothing fancy here. Simple and functional (a few dedicated shortcuts for switching the keyboard layout and some minor visual tweaks)

## Xresources (legacy)
These settings are for the urxvt terminal (which is what I used before switching to ST)
