In 2016, after a long hiatus, I returned to Linux and Arch was a nice discovery for me (knew about it before, of course, but, never used it for real). I ditched the desktop enviroments and went the minimalist/terminal/VM way (started with i3, tried many VMs, settled with dwm and also switched from Arch to Artix).

So far so good! :)
